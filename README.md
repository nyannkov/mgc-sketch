# mgc-sketch

**mgc-sketch** is a helper tool for building small-scale games and gadgets using the **mgc** library as Arduino sketches.

The goal of this project is to make it easy to write, organize, and build compact software using the `mgc` library on platforms like Arduino. 
It is especially suitable for microcontroller-based projects such as toys, instruments, and retro-style games.

## Features

- Build system support for Arduino sketches using mgc
- Easy integration of small game logic and utilities
